# Real-Time Ticketing System

## Introduction
The Real-Time Ticketing System is a multi-threaded application designed to simulate the process of ticket sales and distribution. It allows vendors to release tickets into a shared pool while customers attempt to purchase them concurrently. This system showcases the use of threading, synchronization, and configuration management in Java, providing a practical example of real-time operations in a ticketing scenario.
